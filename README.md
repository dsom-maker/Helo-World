# Helo-World
I am currently studying Information Technology in Takoradi Technical University in Ghana. I am also on a number of programmes including Google Africa Developer Scholarship. I love programming and hope to learn more with my involvement here. I am a student of Java, python and web tech. Hope to meet wonderful people and collaborate to learn more.
